## Story
The game is set within the dreams of a person, and the player must repeatedly journey into a mysterious dungeon, collecting artifacts and coins to improve their chances in subsequent dream runs. Each dream presents a unique level layout, but some common elements persist. The player has limited health and mana, and each character comes with distinct stats. The player's inventory contains slots for up to two weapons, multiple scrolls, and a shared area for coins and artifacts.
